## Things I would like help with

- Optimizing the regexes used for the text replacement
- Helping the extension work with edge cases on popular sites
- Randomizing the replacement text for common cases

## Things I am aware of

- Text replacement is aggressive and does not discriminate on what domains it runs
- There is a lack of a glossary, even though terms are well documented in [the source](https://github.com/shawncothran/and-i-swear/blob/master/Source/content_script.js)
- I'll sometimes allow new terms, but not on any given schedule or via any published criteria
- There is no indication that the extension is running other than text has been replaced
- There is no count of how many words have been changed, either on a given page or historically
